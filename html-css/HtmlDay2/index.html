        <h3>Command Line</h3>
        <p>Command Line or as I like to call it, terminal. Is what we went over in class
            to create and manage projects with tools like git and github. With these tools
            we were able to make directorys, go into directorys, make files, move files, 
            delete files, and much much more.</p>
        <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS or HyperText Markup Language and Cascayding Style Sheet are 
            two major things used in creating webpages. HTML is the bones of the website, 
            creating the skelton of what it will be based on and then CSS applying the skin 
            and muscle to the web page making it look pretty with different styles. Such as 
            Margin, Padding, Color, Background color, font size, fonts and many more.</p>
